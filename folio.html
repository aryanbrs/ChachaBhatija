        <h1>Trading Mistakes to Avoid</h1>
        <h2>1. Lack of Vision: Random Trading Without Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          A clear trading strategy is the backbone of success in the financial
          markets. Without a vision or structured plan, trades become impulsive,
          akin to gambling.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Develop a concrete plan, whether it's a
          technical strategy like breakout trading or a fundamental approach.
          Test it rigorously before implementation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" id="slide2">
        <h2>2. Ignoring Stop Losses: The Five Types of Trades</h2>
        <p>
          Loss management is the cornerstone of trading discipline. Every trade
          falls into one of these categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Profit</li>
          <li>Big Profit</li>
          <li>Break-even</li>
          <li>Loss</li>
          <li>Big Loss</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Big losses should never happen. Trading is a business, and the "cost"
          of this business is the stop loss (SL).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Golden Rule:</strong> If a trade goes wrong, take the SL and
          exit. Avoid averaging down on losing positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Case Study:</strong> A wealthy trader once ignored SL in crude
          oil trades, averaging his position. The market didn’t reverse, and he
          lost everything—home, family, and financial stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Actionable Tip:</strong> Use a risk-to-reward ratio of 1:2 or
          better. For instance, if you're risking 20 points in Sensex, aim to
          gain 40 points. Recovery is possible with one big profitable trade.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" id="slide3">
        <h2>3. Overtrading</h2>
        <p>
          Many traders fall into the trap of overtrading, taking 20–60 trades a
          day, hoping for quick profits. Even seasoned traders rarely exceed
          three trades a day.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Smart Approach:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Take one trade. If profitable, risk 50% of the profit on a second
            trade.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the first trade results in a loss, aim for break-even on the
            second.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stop trading after two consecutive losses and return the next day.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Top 1% Rule:</strong> The world’s best traders take a maximum
          of five trades a day.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" id="slide4">
        <h2>4. BTST and Intraday Trading</h2>
        <p>
          BTST (Buy Today, Sell Tomorrow) is a strategy where traders buy stocks
          intending to sell them the next day. However, overnight market risks
          can wipe out gains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intraday trades are more predictable but require disciplined entry and
          exit points. Avoid holding positions beyond the trading session to
          minimize risk.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" id="slide5">
        <h2>5. Don’t Try to Prove the Market Wrong</h2>
        <p>
          The market is always right. Trading against the trend or trying to
          force a reversal can lead to significant losses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advice:</strong> Respect the market's direction and avoid
          emotional trading.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" id="slide6">
        <h2>6. Avoiding Random Trade Tips</h2>
        <p>
          Following unverified tips from Telegram or WhatsApp can be disastrous.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Stick to your analysis and avoid the herd
          mentality. Develop confidence in your strategy.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" id="slide7">
        <h2>7. Selecting OTM Strike Prices in Options</h2>
        <p>
          Out-of-the-Money (OTM) options may seem cheap, but they decay rapidly
          as expiration nears.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Concept:</strong> Options lose value over time (time decay),
          especially if they're far from the underlying asset's price.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Alternative:</strong> Stick to In-the-Money (ITM) or, at
          worst, At-the-Money (ATM) options for better profitability.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" id="slide8">
        <h2>8. Overexposing Capital</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Mistake:</strong> Allocating all your capital to one trade or
          stock.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Diversify. Beginners should focus on stock
          and swing trading before venturing into complex instruments.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" id="slide9">
        <h2>9. Preparation Before Taking a Trade</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Do What the Chart Says:</strong> Base decisions on strategies
          like the Big Bar Strategy or the 9:30 AM Strategy.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Identify the Trend:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uptrend → Take call positions on dips.</li>
          <li>Downtrend → Take put positions on retracements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Trendlines:</strong> Use higher highs and higher lows for
          uptrends; lower highs and lower lows for downtrends.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Checklist:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Emotions in check.</li>
          <li>No random trades.</li>
          <li>Entry and exit points defined.</li>
          <li>Stop Loss (SL) in place.</li>
          <li>Risk-to-reward ratio calculated.</li>
          <li>Quantity determined.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" id="slide10">
        <h2>10. Post-Trade Actions</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Maintain a trading journal</strong> to track decisions,
          emotions, and outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advice:</strong> Avoid carrying excitement or regret from
          previous trades into new ones. Follow the "Trade Less, Book More"
          strategy to maximize profits. Celebrate wins responsibly—donate a
          portion of your earnings for good karma.
